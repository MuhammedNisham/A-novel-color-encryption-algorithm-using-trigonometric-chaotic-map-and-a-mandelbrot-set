Digital images are vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation, posing significant 
risks to individuals' security and privacy. To address these concerns, advanced encryption 
techniques have been developed.
This project proposes a novel approach that combines trigonometric chaotic map image 
encryption with DNA sequence operations to enhance image security.
The encryption process involves applying chaotic encryption independently to each color 
channel (red, green, and blue) of the image, using a suitable chaotic map selected through a 
map selection algorithm.
To effectively obscure image data, a newly introduced Mandelbrot Set based conditional 
shift algorithm is employed, operating on the individual color channels.
This project seeks to contribute to the advancement of image security protocols, offering a 
promising solution to combat digital image manipulation and safeguard the privacy of 
individuals.
